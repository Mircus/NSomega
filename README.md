- `layers/`: Custom PyTorch layers (e.g., SuperOscLayer)
- `metrics/`: Scripts to compute SEI, WMC, NFDC
- `datasets/`: Generation and preprocessing for SuperOsc-MNIST, Temporal-Chirp
- `notebooks/`: Interactive experiments and visualization
- `visuals/`: Diagrams and results
- `configs/`: Training and experiment configs

## Status
🔬 Protocol: COMPLETE  
🚀 Ready for Implementation: ✅
